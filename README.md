# x86-64 Assembler by Example

*Let the compiler teach you 64-bit x86 assembler, one example at a time.*

## Running the notebook yourself

For cosmetic reasons to code to render assembler from C appears at the end of the notebook (in Appendix A). That means the first attempt to **Run All** will fail because `gcc.py` does not exist until Appendix A has been run. Scroll down to Appendix A and run the cell there. After that simply **Restart and Run All** and it will be solved.
